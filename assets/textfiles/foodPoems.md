Ode on Some Leftover Chinese (Food)
On frozen shelves, in boxed array,
My Oriental feast espied--
What there contained I cannot say,
Yet know inside my heart, 'tis fried.

This platter I did soon construct
Of starches, vegetables and meat--
A dumpling from it's death-cave plucked,
An egg-roll set on saucy seat.

Then I my composition place
Into the cove that warmth renews;
An algorithm writ with grace,
And soon the spinning disc ensues.

Now, now! I must consume it now!
I care not for the timerâ€™s din;
Into the pork I plunge my fork
And find that it is cold within.

Th'analogy of all my life,
These grains of rice that failed to cook:
They are the mirror of my strife,
So small, still they the reaper took.

Ode on a Hot Pocket
What steaming, melted mysteries
Ensconced within thy bready folds!
Strange poultice brewed of meat and cheese,
An ingot worth its weight in gold!

Ah! Savage spark! Thou wicked bite,
Return'd when tasted to the lips,
Then oozing out as sails in flight
From pirates on their blacken'd ships.

Forgive me of my hasty greed,
Impatient to await thy rest,
For thou wert temperate indeed,
and I a thing of mock and jest.

Ode on Stouffer's Five-Cheese Lasagna

From deep within the chamber's cold
The red-and-yellow brick retrieved,
Torn off the 'board, emblazon'd bold
And pierced the film, vapors relieved.
Once frozen in temporal sleep
Now gently wakes the butterfat--
Five sisters spinning, melt and creep,
Coagulate in th'plastic vat.
Too long they bake! Their tresses char'd
And blacken'd into gnarled manes--
They weep, I weep, for wasted lard;
In crib and coffin, stone remains.
